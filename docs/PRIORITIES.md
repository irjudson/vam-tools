# VAM Tools V2 - Implementation Priorities

## Mission
**Get files organized with a single, correct copy of each asset first. Then enable curation and enrichment.**

## Core Philosophy

Visual Asset Management is about establishing a **single source of truth** for your visual assets. Before we can do sophisticated curation, AI-based selection, or advanced management features, we need:

1. **One correct copy** of each unique asset
2. **Correct metadata** (especially dates)
3. **Consistent organization** (chronological structure)
4. **Zero data loss** (every unique asset preserved)

Once we have this foundation, we can build value-added features on top.

## Phase 1: Core Organization (PRIORITY)

### Goal
Transform a chaotic collection of photos/videos into a clean, chronologically organized catalog with no duplicates.

### Critical Features (Must Have)

#### 1.1 Duplicate Detection & Resolution ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Multiple copies waste space and create confusion
- **What**:
  - Perceptual hashing to find duplicates
  - Quality scoring to select the best copy
  - Handle different formats of the same image (RAW + JPEG, different sizes)
  - Merge EXIF metadata from all duplicates into the best copy
  - Delete or archive lower-quality duplicates
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Iteration**: 2 (NEXT)

#### 1.2 Date Extraction & Correction ‚úÖ
- **Why**: Chronological organization requires accurate dates
- **What**:
  - Extract from EXIF, filenames, directories, filesystem
  - Confidence scoring
  - Flag suspicious dates for review
  - Human-in-the-loop for conflicts
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Iteration**: 1

#### 1.3 Catalog Database ‚úÖ
- **Why**: Track state, enable checkpointing, support rollback
- **What**:
  - JSON-based catalog for human readability
  - Checkpoint system for long-running operations
  - Transaction log for reversibility
  - File locking for safety
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Iteration**: 1

#### 1.4 Organization Execution ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Actually organize the files into the target structure
- **What**:
  - YYYY-MM directory structure
  - Move/copy files to organized locations
  - Verify checksums after operations
  - Dry-run mode for safety
  - Rollback support if interrupted
- **Status**: Partially implemented (in V1, needs V2 integration)
- **Iteration**: 3

#### 1.5 Review Interface ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Human oversight for conflicts and edge cases
- **What**:
  - Web UI to review flagged issues
  - Conflict resolution (duplicate dates, missing dates)
  - Batch approval for safe operations
  - Progress monitoring
- **Status**: Basic web viewer exists, needs review features
- **Iteration**: 3

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All unique assets identified (one copy selected)
- ‚úÖ All assets have dates (or flagged for manual review)
- ‚úÖ Files organized into YYYY-MM structure
- ‚úÖ Zero data loss (all unique content preserved)
- ‚úÖ All operations logged and reversible

---

## Phase 2: Import & Maintenance (After Phase 1)

### Goal
Keep the organized catalog current as new assets arrive.

### Features

#### 2.1 Import System
- Watch import directory for new files
- Auto-analyze and integrate new assets
- Detect if new file is duplicate of existing
- Maintain organization as files arrive

#### 2.2 Incremental Updates
- Re-scan for changes in source directories
- Detect moved/renamed files
- Update catalog without re-processing everything

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Curation (Future)

### Goal
Add value through intelligent selection and management.

### Features (Lower Priority)

#### 3.1 Burst Detection & Selection
- Group photos taken in rapid succession
- AI-based quality assessment
- Select best from burst
- Keep others in subfolder or archive

#### 3.2 AI Tagging & Classification
- Auto-tag subjects (people, places, things)
- Scene detection
- Quality scoring
- Smart collections based on AI metadata

#### 3.3 Advanced Features
- Face detection and clustering
- Location clustering
- Event detection (group by time/place)
- Smart search

## Decision Matrix: When to Build What

| Feature | Phase | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Duplicate detection | 1 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Can't have "one copy" without this |
| Date extraction | 1 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Already done, essential for organization |
| Organization execution | 1 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | The actual goal - moving files |
| Review UI | 1 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Human oversight needed for conflicts |
| Import system | 2 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Needed after initial organization |
| Burst detection | 3 | ‚≠ê | Nice to have, not essential for organization |
| AI features | 3 | ‚≠ê | Value-add after core organization works |

## What We're NOT Building Yet

**Deliberately deferred until Phase 1 is complete:**

- ‚ùå Burst detection and selection
- ‚ùå AI-based quality assessment (beyond basic heuristics)
- ‚ùå Face detection
- ‚ùå Auto-tagging
- ‚ùå Smart collections
- ‚ùå Advanced search
- ‚ùå Editing/annotation features
- ‚ùå Sharing/export workflows

**Why**: These are all value-added features that depend on having a clean, organized foundation first.
